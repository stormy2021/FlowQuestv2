# FlowQuest Development TODO

## Development Environment âœ…
- [x] Docker containerization with Cursor IDE
- [x] Monorepo structure (mobile/, backend/, shared/)
- [x] ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configuration
- [x] PostgreSQL and Redis services running
- [x] React Native project initialization
- [x] Basic navigation structure (Auth â†’ Tabs)
- [x] **MAJOR DEBUG SESSION COMPLETE** - Fixed core module resolution issues:
  - [x] iOS AppDelegate.mm module name mismatch (FlowQuestTemp â†’ FlowQuest)
  - [x] Xcode scheme configuration corrected
  - [x] Compatible version matrix established (Expo SDK 50 + RN 0.73.x + Reanimated 3.10.0)
  - [x] Metro bundler operational on localhost:8081/8082

## ðŸš¨ Deployment Readiness Blockers (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **@babel/runtime Module Resolution** - Metro can't find babel runtime helpers
  - [ ] Investigate babel.config.js monorepo configuration
  - [ ] Check metro.config.js nodeModulesPaths resolution
  - [ ] Clear Metro caches and test minimal bundle
- [ ] **CocoaPods SSL Certificate Issue** - Preventing iOS native builds
  - [ ] Try git-based pod sources instead of CDN
  - [ ] Update macOS certificate trust or use --insecure workaround
  - [ ] Generate complete Podfile.lock
- [ ] **Package Version Alignment** - Multiple version mismatches with Expo SDK 50
  - [ ] Run `npx expo install --fix`
  - [ ] Verify no breaking changes
- [ ] **iOS Simulator Launch Test** - Complete end-to-end validation
