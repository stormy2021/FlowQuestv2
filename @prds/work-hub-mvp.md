# Work Hub MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Transform ServiceNow's traditional incident/change/request tables into an engaging, card-based mobile interface with gesture-driven actions and priority-based visual design.

## Problem Statement

Current ServiceNow mobile experience requires 6+ clicks to resolve a simple incident:
- Navigate to ITSM → Incidents → My Incidents → Select incident → Scroll to actions → Resolve
- No visual priority indicators beyond text labels
- Actions buried in forms or menus
- Static, table-based interface lacks mobile optimization

## Solution

**Card-Based Work Feed**: Replace incident tables with scrollable cards showing priority, assignment, and SLA status
**Swipe-to-Action**: Left swipe to resolve, right swipe to escalate/reassign
**Priority-Based Visual System**: Color-coded cards with pulsing animations for critical incidents
**Progressive Disclosure**: Tap to expand card for full details in tabbed bottom sheet

## User Stories

### Core Stories
- **As an IT technician**, I want to see my assigned incidents as cards with clear visual priorities, so I can focus on critical issues first
- **As a resolver**, I want to resolve incidents with a simple swipe gesture, so I can clear my queue faster
- **As a manager**, I want to reassign incidents by swiping right, so I can balance team workload efficiently
- **As a user**, I want to see SLA compliance as animated progress rings, so I understand urgency at a glance

### Secondary Stories
- **As a resolver**, I want to add quick comments while swiping to resolve, so I can document solutions efficiently
- **As a technician**, I want related problems/changes to appear as contextual cards, so I can see connections
- **As a user**, I want pull-to-refresh to get latest incident updates, so my view stays current

## Functional Requirements

### Mock ServiceNow Data Service
- **Realistic incident data** with varied priorities (P1-P4), states, assignment patterns
- **Mock API endpoints** that simulate ServiceNow REST responses
- **Priority distribution**: 5% P1, 15% P2, 60% P3, 20% P4
- **Status variety**: New, In Progress, On Hold, Resolved states
- **Assigned users**: Mix of assigned and unassigned incidents

### Card-Based Interface
- **Incident cards** replacing traditional table rows
- **Priority color system**: P1 Red (pulsing), P2 Orange, P3 Yellow, P4 Blue
- **Card content**: Number, short description, assignee avatar, time indicators
- **SLA visualization**: Circular progress rings showing time remaining
- **Status badges**: Clear visual states (New, In Progress, etc.)

### Gesture System
- **Left swipe**: Reveal resolve action (green background animation)
- **Right swipe**: Reveal reassign/escalate actions (orange/red backgrounds)
- **Swipe threshold**: 40% of card width to trigger action
- **Haptic feedback**: Light impact on gesture start, selection feedback on action trigger
- **Spring animation**: Card snaps back if gesture doesn't meet threshold

### Priority-Based Visual System
- **Critical (P1)**: Red cards with pulsing glow animation, priority icon
- **High (P2)**: Orange cards with subtle shadow elevation
- **Medium (P3)**: Yellow/amber cards, standard appearance
- **Low (P4)**: Blue cards, slightly reduced opacity

## Technical Requirements

### Data Layer
- **Mock service**: `mobile/src/services/api/mockServiceNow.ts`
- **TypeScript interfaces**: Incident, Priority, Status, User types
- **Data persistence**: Temporary state management (Zustand store)
- **Refresh mechanism**: Pull-to-refresh triggers data reload

### UI Components
- **IncidentCard**: Main card component with priority styling
- **SwipeableCard**: Wrapper handling gesture detection and animations
- **PriorityIndicator**: Visual priority badges with animations
- **SLAProgressRing**: Circular progress component
- **ActionReveal**: Background actions revealed on swipe

### Animation Requirements
- **60+ FPS**: Smooth gesture tracking and spring animations
- **React Native Reanimated 3**: For UI thread animations
- **Gesture Handler 2**: For native gesture recognition
- **Lottie animations**: Completion celebrations, loading states

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Work Hub displays scrollable feed of incident cards (not placeholder text)
- [ ] Cards show realistic ServiceNow data with proper priorities and assignments
- [ ] Priority-based color coding with P1 incidents visually distinct (red, pulsing)
- [ ] Left swipe gesture resolves incident with animation and haptic feedback
- [ ] Right swipe gesture reveals reassign options
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh reloads incident data
- [ ] Tapping card expands to show full incident details

### Should Have
- [ ] SLA progress rings showing time remaining/compliance percentage
- [ ] Quick comment field when resolving incidents via swipe
- [ ] Related incidents/problems appear as contextual suggestions
- [ ] Loading states and empty states with proper messaging

### Could Have
- [ ] Incident filtering by priority/assignment/status
- [ ] Search functionality within incident feed
- [ ] Batch actions for multiple incident selection
- [ ] Dark mode support with adjusted color scheme

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Gesture success rate**: >90% of swipe gestures complete intended action
- **Task completion time**: <10 seconds to resolve incident (vs 30+ seconds in current flow)
- **Animation performance**: Maintains 60+ FPS during card interactions

### Technical Performance
- **Feed scroll performance**: Smooth scrolling with 50+ cards
- **Memory usage**: <100MB for incident feed with realistic data set
- **Gesture responsiveness**: <16ms response time to gesture input

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
1. **Start with static cards** showing mock data with proper styling
2. **Add gesture detection** without actions first (log gestures)
3. **Implement swipe actions** with animations
4. **Polish priority-based visuals** and micro-interactions
5. **Add haptic feedback** and celebration animations

### Dependencies
- Mock ServiceNow data service must be created first
- Shared TypeScript types for ServiceNow entities
- Basic card component library for consistent styling

### Future Considerations
- Real ServiceNow API integration will replace mock service
- SQLite caching for offline incident access
- Push notifications for incident assignments
- Multi-instance support for different ServiceNow environments
