# User Experience & Gamification - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Create an engaging "Me Hub" that transforms individual user interactions with ServiceNow into a personalized, achievement-oriented experience with contribution tracking, subtle gamification, and professional growth visualization.

## Problem Statement

Current ServiceNow user experience lacks personal engagement:
- No visibility into individual contributions and impact
- Generic user profiles with basic information only
- No recognition or feedback for good ServiceNow citizenship
- Notifications scattered and often irrelevant
- Users feel like anonymous cogs in enterprise machine

## Solution

**Personal Achievement System**: Track and visualize individual contributions with professional recognition
**Contribution Timeline**: Show user's ServiceNow journey as an engaging arc of resolved cases and completed projects
**Smart Notifications**: Context-aware, actionable notifications with quick response options
**Professional Gamification**: Subtle achievement system focused on expertise, helpfulness, and efficiency

## User Stories

### Personal Dashboard Stories
- **As a ServiceNow user**, I want to see my contributions visualized as an achievement timeline, so I feel recognized for my work
- **As a team member**, I want to track my expertise areas and impact metrics, so I can demonstrate professional growth
- **As a professional**, I want achievements that reflect real business value, so gamification feels appropriate for enterprise context

### Notification & Preferences Stories
- **As a busy professional**, I want smart notifications that only surface actionable items, so I'm not overwhelmed by noise
- **As a mobile user**, I want quick response options in notifications, so I can act without opening full applications

### Profile & Recognition Stories
