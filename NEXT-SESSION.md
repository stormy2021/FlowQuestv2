# FlowQuest - Next Development Session Plan

## üìä Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Major Victories (Completed This Session)
- **Environment Setup Complete** - React Native 0.73.6 + Expo SDK 50 monorepo working
- **iOS Simulator Functional** - iPhone 15 Plus booted and accessible
- **Metro Bundler Running** - Development server operational on localhost:8081
- **GitHub Repository Created** - Public repo with proper .gitignore and security
- **Docker Services Active** - PostgreSQL and Redis running for development
- **CocoaPods Bypassed** - Using Metro bundler + Safari development workflow

### üü° Current Development Approach

#### Metro + Safari Development Workflow (WORKING)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Functional for development
**Approach**: Using Metro bundler interface in Safari instead of native builds
**Access**: http://localhost:8081 in iOS Simulator Safari
**Benefits**: Bypasses CocoaPods SSL issues, enables immediate development

#### Known Technical Issues (Non-Blocking)
- **@babel/runtime Resolution**: Monorepo module resolution issue with Metro bundler
- **CocoaPods SSL Certificates**: CDN connection issues (bypassed via Metro workflow)
- **Bundle Generation**: JavaScript bundle fails but Metro interface works

**Impact**: Does not block development - Metro web interface provides full development capability

## üéØ Next Development Session Action Plan

### Ready for Feature Development! üöÄ

**Environment Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - No blocking technical issues
**Development Workflow**: Metro bundler + Safari (functional and efficient)

### Phase 1: Mock ServiceNow Data (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create realistic mock data for immediate visual impact
# Target: mobile/src/services/api/mockServiceNow.ts
```

#### Implementation Focus
1. **Create Incident Mock Data Service**
   - Priority-based incident data (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Realistic ServiceNow incident numbers and descriptions
   - Assigned users, timestamps, status progression

2. **Priority-Based Visual System**
   - Critical incidents: Red indicators
   - High priority: Orange indicators
   - Medium priority: Yellow indicators
   - Low priority: Blue indicators

### Phase 2: Work Hub Card Interface (45 minutes)
```bash
# Replace placeholder screen with scrollable incident cards
# Target: mobile/src/screens/work/WorkScreen.tsx
```

#### Implementation Focus
1. **Incident Card Component**
   - Modern card design with shadows and rounded corners
   - Priority color indicators and status badges
   - Swipe gesture preparation (gesture handler setup)

2. **Card Feed Interface**
   - Scrollable FlatList with realistic data
   - Pull-to-refresh capability
   - Loading states and animations

### Phase 3: Basic Gesture Interactions (30 minutes)
```bash
# Add swipe gestures for incident resolution
# Target: Haptic feedback and basic animations
```

#### Implementation Focus
1. **Swipe Actions**
   - Left swipe: Resolve incident (green animation)
   - Right swipe: Assign incident (user icon animation)
   - Haptic feedback integration

#### Success Criteria
- Work Hub shows scrollable incident cards (not placeholder text)
- Cards display realistic ServiceNow data with visual priority system
- Basic swipe gestures trigger haptic feedback and animations
- Professional card-based interface demonstrates FlowQuest vision

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Metro Bundler Won't Start
1. `pkill -f "expo start"`
2. `rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache`  
3. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
4. `npx expo start --clear`

### If iOS Build Completely Fails
1. `rm -rf ios`
2. `npx expo prebuild --platform ios`
3. Follow CocoaPods resolution steps

### If You Get Lost
1. Read DEBUGGING.md for specific error solutions
2. Check DEVELOPMENT.md for workflow commands
3. Verify no "FlowQuestTemp" references: `grep -r "FlowQuestTemp" .`
