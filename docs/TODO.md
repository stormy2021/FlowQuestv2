# FlowQuest Development TODO

## ðŸ“– Documentation Structure (REORGANIZED)

### Product Requirements
**See: `/prds/` folder** for focused product requirements documents:
- `work-hub-mvp.md` - Core incident/change card interface with gesture actions
- `asset-management.md` - ITAM lifecycle visualization and contract management
- `people-hr-workflows.md` - HR onboarding gamification and case management
- `user-experience-gamification.md` - Personal achievements and contribution tracking
- `servicenow-integration.md` - OAuth 2.0, API client, and real-time webhooks
- `offline-caching-system.md` - SQLite caching and smart synchronization

### Issue Tracking
**See: `docs/ISSUES.md`** for centralized technical issue tracking including:
- ðŸš¨ Critical P0 blockers (CocoaPods SSL, @babel/runtime)
- ðŸŸ¡ High priority limitations (Metro + Safari workaround)
- ðŸŸ  Medium priority technical debt
- Architectural decisions and reasoning

### Historical Reference
**See: `/archive/` folder** for historical documentation:
- `DEBUGGING.md` - Past debugging sessions and solutions
- `NEXT-SESSION.md` - Previous session planning (archived)
- `External_References.md` - ServiceNow API references and credentials

## ðŸš€ Current Development Status

### Environment Status: âœ… FUNCTIONAL (Not Optimal)
- [x] Docker containerization with PostgreSQL + Redis
- [x] Monorepo structure (mobile/, backend/, shared/)
- [x] React Native 0.73.6 + Expo SDK 50 working configuration
- [x] Metro bundler + Safari development workflow operational
- [x] Basic hub navigation structure implemented

### Critical Blockers: ðŸš¨ P0 URGENT
**See `docs/ISSUES.md` for detailed tracking**
- [ ] **CocoaPods SSL Certificate Issue** - Blocking full Expo testing capabilities
- [ ] **@babel/runtime Module Resolution** - JavaScript bundle generation fails

### Development Approach: Metro + Safari Workaround
- **Current**: Using `cd mobile && npm start` â†’ Safari at `localhost:8081`
- **Goal**: Full Expo testing with device deployment capabilities
- **Status**: Functional for feature development, not production-ready

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priorities (Next Sprints)

### Sprint 1-2: Core Features (Ready to Start)
Implement features from PRD documents while infrastructure issues are resolved:
- [ ] Work Hub MVP - Mock ServiceNow data service and card interface
- [ ] Basic gesture system for incident resolution
- [ ] Priority-based visual system for incident cards

### Sprint 3-4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Asset management carousel interface
- [ ] People hub with onboarding progress visualization
- [ ] ServiceNow integration foundation (when P0 issues resolved)

### Sprint 5-6: Polish & Integration
- [ ] Me hub with personal achievements
- [ ] Offline caching system implementation
- [ ] Real-time notifications and webhooks

---

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tracking by Hub

### Work Hub (From `prds/work-hub-mvp.md`)
- [ ] Mock ServiceNow data service with realistic incident data
- [ ] IncidentCard component with priority-based styling
- [ ] Swipe gesture system (left: resolve, right: reassign/escalate)
- [ ] SLA progress rings and priority animations
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh functionality

### Assets Hub (From `prds/asset-management.md`)
- [ ] Asset carousel navigation (Hardware, Software, Facilities)
- [ ] Lifecycle visualization with progress indicators
- [ ] Contract expiration alerts with pulsing animations
- [ ] Asset assignment drag-and-drop gestures

### People Hub (From `prds/people-hr-workflows.md`)
- [ ] Employee profile cards with photos and context
- [ ] Onboarding journey visualization with milestone celebrations
- [ ] HR case management with person-centered approach
- [ ] Gamified progress tracking for onboarding tasks

### Me Hub (From `prds/user-experience-gamification.md`)
- [ ] Personal contribution timeline visualization
- [ ] Professional achievement system with business-focused milestones
- [ ] Smart notification center with quick actions
- [ ] Expertise area detection and badges

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Queue

### Backend Integration (From `prds/servicenow-integration.md`)
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow implementation
- [ ] Direct ServiceNow REST API client
- [ ] Real-time webhook processing via Azure Functions
- [ ] Multi-instance ServiceNow support

### Data & Offline (From `prds/offline-caching-system.md`)
- [ ] SQLite database schema design
- [ ] Priority-based caching algorithms
- [ ] Incremental sync with timestamp tracking
- [ ] Offline action queuing and conflict resolution

### Performance & Polish
- [ ] React Native Reanimated 3 animation system
- [ ] 60+ FPS performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Accessibility and localization support

---

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics & Validation

### User Experience Goals
- **Task Completion**: <10 seconds to resolve incident (vs 30+ in current flow)
- **Gesture Success**: >90% of swipe gestures complete intended action
- **Performance**: 60+ FPS animations on mid-range devices

### Technical Goals
- **Offline Capability**: 90% of common operations available offline
- **Real-time**: <5 seconds from ServiceNow event to mobile notification
- **Cache Efficiency**: <10MB incremental sync operations

---

## ðŸš¨ Critical Path Dependencies

### Before Production Deployment
1. **Resolve P0 Issues**: CocoaPods SSL and @babel/runtime resolution
2. **TestFlight Distribution**: Requires native iOS build capabilities
3. **ServiceNow Integration**: OAuth 2.0 flow and API client implementation
4. **Performance Validation**: Device testing with real hardware

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Development**: Build features using Metro + Safari while resolving infrastructure
- **Incremental Testing**: Test components individually before full integration
- **Fallback Options**: Maintain current workaround until full native builds working

---

## ðŸ“… Milestone Planning

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): MVP Features
Focus on PRD implementation while P0 issues are resolved in parallel

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Integration & Testing
ServiceNow integration, offline capabilities, device testing

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Polish & Deployment
Performance optimization, TestFlight beta, App Store preparation

**Next Session Priority**: Begin Work Hub MVP implementation from `prds/work-hub-mvp.md`
**Parallel Track**: Continue resolving P0 infrastructure issues from `docs/ISSUES.md`
**Success Criteria**: Demonstrate FlowQuest vision with professional card-based interface
